# Project Brief: AI Video Editor

## 1. Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered video generation and editing application. The primary goal is to streamline the workflow of creating videos from AI-generated clips by integrating generation and editing tools within a single application.

## 2. Core Goals

*   **Unified Workflow:** Allow users to generate video clips using AI (text-to-video, image-to-video) and edit them (stitch, trim, add audio, transitions) within the same interface.
*   **Local AI Focus:** Prioritize the use of open-source, locally runnable AI models for generation tasks where feasible.
*   **Professional Feel:** Develop a clean, intuitive, and professional user interface, potentially drawing inspiration from established video editing software.
*   **Extensibility:** Build a foundation that can be expanded with more advanced AI generation controls (e.g., camera angles) and editing features over time.

## 3. Initial Scope (v1)

*   Basic AI video generation (e.g., text-to-video).
*   Core video editing timeline: stitching clips, basic trimming.
*   Audio track support (adding existing audio).
*   Initial UI resembling standard video editors.
*   Platform: Desktop application (likely Electron-based) to facilitate local AI model usage.

## 4. Target User

Initially, the primary user is Russell (the developer) for personal projects, but designed with professional standards for potential future publishing.
