# System Patterns: AI Video Editor

## 1. High-Level Architecture (Anticipated)

Given the choice of a Desktop Application (likely Electron-based) with Python for AI model interaction:

*   **Frontend (UI Layer):**
    *   Built with web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript).
    *   Using React (potentially with Next.js structure/tooling adapted for Electron) for building the user interface components (timeline, media bins, preview, generation controls).
    *   Communicates with the Main Process (Electron) for backend operations, file system access, and AI task requests.

*   **Main Process (Electron - Node.js Environment):
    *   Manages the application lifecycle, windows, menus, and native OS integrations.
    *   Acts as a bridge between the Frontend (Renderer Process) and the Python Backend.
    *   Handles inter-process communication (IPC) to receive requests from the UI and send results back.
    *   May handle some core application logic not directly tied to AI (e.g., project file management).

*   **Backend (Python Environment):
    *   Manages and runs local AI models for video generation, audio generation, music generation, etc.
    *   Likely exposed as a local server (e.g., using FastAPI or Flask) that the Electron Main Process can communicate with via HTTP requests, or through direct Python script execution managed by the Main Process.
    *   Handles tasks like model loading, inference, and potentially some video/audio processing tasks that are more easily done in Python.
    *   Requires secure handling of any user credentials if cloud services are ever integrated.

## 2. Key Technical Decisions (Initial Thoughts)

*   **Platform:** Desktop Application (Electron).
*   **UI Technology:** JavaScript/TypeScript with React.
*   **AI Model Management:** Python backend, potentially with a local API for communication.
*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Electron's IPC mechanisms for Frontend <-> Main Process. HTTP or direct script calls for Main Process <-> Python Backend.
*   **Project File Format:** A structured format (e.g., JSON or XML) will be needed to save project state (timeline, media references, edits).

## 3. Design Patterns (To Consider)

*   **Model-View-Controller (MVC) / Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM):** For organizing UI and application logic in the frontend.
*   **Observer Pattern:** For updating UI elements in response to changes in data (e.g., generation progress, timeline updates).
*   **Command Pattern:** For representing editing operations, enabling undo/redo functionality.
*   **Service/Repository Pattern:** For abstracting data access and business logic, especially if interacting with different AI models or file systems.
