# Product Context: AI Video Editor

## 1. Problem Space

Creating videos using current AI generation tools often involves a fragmented workflow:
1.  Generate individual video clips using one or more AI tools/websites/apps.
2.  Download these clips.
3.  Import clips into a separate, traditional video editing software.
4.  Stitch clips together, trim, add audio, effects, etc.
5.  If a clip needs regeneration, the user must go back to the generation tool and repeat the process.

This context switching is inefficient and hinders creative flow.

## 2. Proposed Solution

An integrated desktop application that combines AI video generation capabilities with standard video editing features.

## 3. Key Features & User Experience Goals

*   **Seamless Generation & Editing:** Users should be able to prompt for video clips directly within the application and immediately see them on a timeline or in a media bin, ready for editing.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Easy re-generation of specific clips directly from the editing interface if the initial result isn't satisfactory.
*   **Familiar Editing UI:** Provide a user interface that feels familiar to users of existing video editors (e.g., timeline-based, media bins, preview window), focusing on cleanliness and usability.
*   **Local Control:** Empower users by enabling the use of locally run AI models, offering more control and potentially lower costs compared to purely cloud-based services.
*   **Comprehensive Tooling (Long-term):** Evolve towards a powerful editor including features like transitions, effects, titles, audio mixing, and advanced AI controls (camera movement, style consistency), alongside AI audio/music generation and potentially script/storyboard assistance.

## 4. Why Now?

The increasing quality and availability of open-source AI models for video and audio generation make integrating these capabilities directly into an editing workflow more feasible and desirable.
